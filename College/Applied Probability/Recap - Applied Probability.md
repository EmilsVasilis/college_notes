- Random variables: discrete and continuous
- Discrete distributions
- Continuous distributions

### [[Random Variables]]
What is a random variable? 
- the ‘outcome’ from an ‘experiment’ 

You won’t know the outcome in advance, but you can think about:
- what are the possible values or range of values?
-  with what probability are certain values, or ranges of values, likely to occur? 

Random variables can be discrete or continuous. 

We talk about the ‘distribution’ of a random variable.

### [[Discrete distributions]]
To characterize a discrete distribution, we can think about:
- possible values probability mass function ([[pmf]]), 
- P(X = x) cumulative distribution function ([[cdf]]), 
- P(X ≤ x) mean or expected value, E[X] 
- [[variance]], Var(X)

Some commonly known discrete distributions 
- [[Bernoulli]] 
- [[Binomial]]
- [[Poisson ]]
- [[Geometric ]] 
- Negative binomial 
- Hypergeometric Uniform

## Continuous Distributions
To characterize a continuous distribution, we can think about: 
- the range of values 
- probability density function (pdf), f (x) ≥ 0, and R ∞ −∞ f (x)dx = 1
-  cumulative distribution function (cdf), F(a) = P(X ≤ a) = R a −∞ f (x)dx. 

  Mean or expected value, E[X] 
  variance, Var(X) 
  
  Some commonly known continuous distributions 
  - [[Normal]] 
  - [[Uniform ]]
  - [[Exponential]]
