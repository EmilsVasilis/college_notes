## Why do we need so many then? 
› No Free Lunch Theorem 
› Different applications/different behaviour based on input 

**Examples**
- Merge sort: useful for linked lists 
- Quicksort: excellent average-case behaviour 
- [[Insertion Sort]]: good if your list is already almost sorted
- Bubble sort:  if small enough data set, it is the simplest to implement
