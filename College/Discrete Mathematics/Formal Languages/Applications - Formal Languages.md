# Applications of Formal Languages and Grammars as well as Automata Theory:
1. Compiler architecture uses context-free grammars 
2. Parsers - recognize if commands comply with the syntax of a language 
3. Pattern matching and data mining - guess the language from a given set of words (applied in CS, genetics, etc.) 
4. Natural language processing - example in David Wilkins’ notes pp.40-44 
5. Checking proofs by computers/automatic theorem proving - simpler example of this kind in David Wilkins’ notes pp.45-57 that pertains to propositional logic 
6.  The theory of regular expressions enables 
	(a) grep/awk/sed in Unix 
	(b) More efficient coding (avoiding unnecessary detours in your code) 
7.  Biology - John Conway’s game of life is a cellular automaton 
8. Modeling of AI characters in games uses the finite state automaton idea. Our character can choose among different behaviors based on stimuli - like a finite state automaton reacting to input 
9. Strategy and tactics in games - teach the opposition to recognize certain patterns, then suddenly change them to gain an advantage and score - used in football, fencing, etc. 
10. Learning a sport/a numerical instrument/a new field or subject - split the information into blocks and learn how to combine them into meaningful patterns - uses notions from context-sensitive grammars. 11. Finite state automata and probability Markov chains - chaos theory, financial mathematics.
